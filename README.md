This Project is our solution to the task presented at the Nova Poshta Hackathon in Kyiv in August 2023. Nova Poshta is the leading posting service provider in Ukraine. The main goal was to develop a bot able to interact with customers and help them solve their inquiries. Our final solution was able to interact with users via text or voice, answer their questions on different topics corresponding to the services provided by the company, and perform operations on their shipments (create new, adjust already existing, etc)
